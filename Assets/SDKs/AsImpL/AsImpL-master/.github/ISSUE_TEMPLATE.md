### Precheck

> * For proposing a new feature, please check existing open and closed issues before creating a duplicate
> * For bugs, do a quick search and make sure the bug has not yet been reported
> * Finally, follow the code of conduct (at <https://github.com/gpvigano/AsImpL/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>)

### Environment
>Please specify:
> * version of AsImpL (Github master commit hash or at least date/hour when you downloaded it)
> * version of Unity3D (e.g. Unity 5.4.4f1)

### Steps to reproduce

> For issues related to a specific 3D model try to identify which are the features of the model that cause the issue, or at least attach as a ZIP archive a very simple (lightweight) 3D model that has the same problem. If this is not possible you can send that model via e-mail to <gpv.code@gmail.com> with a subject starting with "*[AsImpL] 3D model-*", then you can create a related issue.

> For general bugs, attempt to recreate the issue with a simple example code and provide steps to reproduce if possible. Include code samples, errors and stacktraces if appropriate.

### Expected behavior

> For general bugs, briefly describe what you expect should happen.

### Current behavior

> For general bugs, briefly describe what is actually happening.
